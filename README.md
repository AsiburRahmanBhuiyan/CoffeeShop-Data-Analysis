# Project Title: Coffee Shop Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze various aspects of a coffee shop, including total sales, average bill per person, order quantity based on months, weekdays, and hourly basis, as well as sales across different locations of store branches and product categories.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
This involved processing and organizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Excel Functions and Tools Used:
Excel functions and tools such as Power Query, slicers, pivot tables, SUM, and DAX were utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Visualization:
A dynamic dashboard was created, comprising bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and donut charts to effectively visualize and compare the analyzed data.

## Key Findings:
The analysis revealed that customers tend to buy coffee from the coffee shop mostly in the middle of the year, such as June and May. The most sold products are coffee and tea, which cover almost 60% of their sales. The favorite item is Barista espresso, and customers mostly opt for large cup sizes. Friday and Monday are the most selling weekdays, and the rush hour is between 9 to 10 in the morning.
